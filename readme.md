# UC Davis Library Wordpress Plugins

This repository contains Wordpress plugins used for the [main UC Davis Library site](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/main-wp-website) and other Library WP properties.

## Deployment
For a nice dockerized deployment pattern, see the [main website deployment repo](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/main-wp-website-deployment). As a rule, [Timber](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/installation/) is a dependency for these plugins. Refer to the [UCD theme](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/main-wp-website-deployment) for the exact version number.
